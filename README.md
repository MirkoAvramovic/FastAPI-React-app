# FastAPI-React-app

This is a sample project demonstrating how to build a web application using FastAPI for the backend and React for the frontend.

## Overview

- The backend is built with FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python. It provides a RESTful API to manage financial transactions.

- The frontend is built with React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Users can enter and view financial transactions through a user-friendly web interface.

## Features

- **Create Transactions**: Users can enter financial transactions, including amount, category, description, income status, and date.

- **View Transactions**: The web interface displays a list of transactions, allowing users to see the transactions they've added.

## Getting Started
